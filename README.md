# Simple Caesar cipher



This Python code implements a simple Caesar cipher for both encryption and decryption. It allows you to shift letters in a message by a specified number of positions, making it a basic but fun way to encode and decode secret messages.

## Key features:

Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
Allows you to specify the shift value for customization.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
Provides clear function names and comments for easy understanding.
## How to use:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Save the code: Copy the code provided and save it as a Python file (e.g., caesar_cipher.py).
Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type python caesar_cipher.py.
Follow the prompts: Enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt and the desired shift value.
See the results: The script will print the original message, the encrypted/decrypted version, and a confirmation message.

## Example:

Original message: Hello, world!
Shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, zruog!
Decrypted message: Hello, world!
